CM3050 Mobile Development


## Module Description

Mobile technology, including smartphones and tablets, has been a significant technology
platform in recent times and the mobile app ecosystem is a significant driver of both
innovation and employment. Mobile development is, therefore, a critical applied area of
computer science. This module will support you in getting started in mobile development,
and it builds on material such as databases, networking and web development taught
elsewhere in the programme.

This module is designed to give you an overview of the mobile development ecosystem
as well as how to design, develop and test create cross-platform mobile apps built using
React Native.

Learners get to achieve the above through a heavily practical approach, using a mixture
of weekly programming exercises, code demonstrations, videos and quizzes.

## Module Goals and Objectives

Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:

1. Design an apps user interface based on a set of requirements and goals,
2. Critically discuss UX techniques used by prominent applications,
3. Design wireframes to inform the testing and development process,
4. Replicate different design styles across devices,
5. Create accessible applications,
6. Create responsive applications that adapt to device requirements,
7. Design and create UI elements, linking them to actions,
8. Utilise navigation systems across devices,
9. Assess the use and performance of more advanced UI elements such as scroll
views and table views,
10. Create precise and useful unit tests to help monitor the performance of an
application,
11. Integrate API’s within your application. Making authenticated requests,
12. Access and use sensors found on mobile devices, e.g. camera, accelerometer,
13. Create app bundles that can be submitted to the relevant app stores.


## Textbook and Readings

Specific essential readings are available for each week and are included on the
Coursera page.

## Activities of This Module

The course is comprised of the following elements:

• Lecture videos: In each week the concepts you need to know will be presented
through a collection of short video lectures. You may stream these videos for
playback within the browser by clicking on their titles or download the videos.

• Practice Quizzes: Topics include practice quizzes, intended for you to assess
your understanding of the content. You will be allowed unlimited attempts at each
practice quiz. There is no time limit on how long you take to complete each 
attempt at the quiz. These quizzes do not contribute toward your final score in
the class.

• Practice Programming exercises (hack-it tasks): Every week you will apply
what you learned by completing short, engaging programming exercises. These
assignments do not contribute toward your final score in the class.

• Graded Assignments: There are two graded assignments, CW1 is worth 30%
of the final module grade and CW2 is worth 70% of the final module grade. Each
assignment comprises multiple parts which learners work on during earlier
weeks. All assignments will be graded by the project tutors.

• Discussion Prompts: Topics also include discussion prompts. You will see the
discussion prompt alongside other items in the lesson. Each prompt provides a
space for you to respond. After responding, you can see and comment on your
peers' responses. All prompts and responses are also accessible from the
general discussion forum and the topic discussion forum.

• Readings: Topics may include several suggested readings. They are good
supplementary materials for you to further understand the module topics.


## How to Pass This Module

The module will contain a range of summative and formative assessments. Summative
assessments are assessments which contribute directly towards your final grade.
Formative assessments do not count directly towards your final grade. Instead, they
provide you with opportunities for low stakes practice and will often provide some sort of
feedback about your progress. For example, a practice quiz might provide you with
feedback about why a particular answer was wrong.

The course has two major assessments. One worth 30% of your grade and one worth
70% of your grade:

• Coursework 1: this assignment comprises a portfolio of assignments completed
in the weeks prior (approximate deadline in week 13).

• Coursework 2: This assignment is a more substantial programming project and
supplementary material, which is extensively detailed in week 10 (approximate
deadline in week 22).
